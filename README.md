Network Packet Sniffer:
-This project is a simple network packet sniffer implemented in Python. It captures and parses various network protocols, including Ethernet, IPv4, ICMP, TCP, and UDP. This tool provides a detailed breakdown of packet contents, which can be useful for network analysis and debugging.

Features
-Captures all network traffic using a raw socket.
-Parses Ethernet frames and extracts source and destination MAC addresses.
-Parses IPv4 packets and extracts source and destination IP addresses, as well as other header information.
-Parses ICMP packets and extracts type, code, and checksum.
-Parses TCP segments and extracts source and destination ports, sequence and acknowledgment numbers, and flags.
-Parses UDP segments and extracts source and destination ports and length.
-Prerequisites
-Python 3.x
Root or administrator privileges (required to create raw sockets).
Usage
-Clone the repository
-Run the script with root privileges
